## About Netwatch
Service to provide all kind of security checks. 

For more intuitive architecture of the project class name style was chosen to be sceuomorphic. 


Service in his final version could be used to check data(API request, parsing, etc) and make auto-verdict or allow user to look the results to make custom verdict. To understand how it works u just need to know how police works. :)
